buftabs
=======

Introduction
------------

This plugin shows a tab-like list of buffers in the bottom of the window.
Because the list is displayed in the statusline or the commandline,
no additional windows or lines are used.

Installation
------------

I encourage using vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle ):

```vimscript
Bundle 'szarski/buftabs'
```

Configuration
-------------

  * `g:buftabs_formatter_pattern`

    Set a pattern for displaying your buffer names.
    Patterns can be built using expressions:

      * `[bufnum]` - buffer number in vi
      * `[bufname]` - buffer name in vi
      * `[root_tail]` - highest directory name of the root
      * `[short_path_letters]` - first letters of the path after root 
      * `[filename]` - file name

    Example usage:
    ```vimscript
    let g:buftabs_formatter_pattern = '[root_tail]/[short_path_letters][filename]'
    ```

  * `g:buftabs_in_statusline`

    Define this variable to make the plugin show the buftabs in the statusline
    instead of the command line. It is a good idea to configure vim to show
    the statusline as well when only one window is open. Add to your .vimrc:

    ```vimscript
    let laststatus=2
    let g:buftabs_in_statusline=1
    ```
     
    By default buftabs will take up the whole of the left-aligned section of
    your statusline. You can alternatively specify precisely where it goes
    using `%{buftabs#statusline()}` e.g.:

    ```vimscript
    let statusline=%=buffers:\ %{buftabs#statusline()}
    ```

  * `g:buftabs_marker_start`
  * `g:buftabs_marker_end`

    Define to change the markers surrounging currently active buffer

    ```vimscript
    let g:buftabs_marker_start='<'
    let g:buftabs_marker_end='>'
    ```
  * `g:buftabs_marker_modified`

    Set the marker appended to modified buffers

    ```vimscript
    let g:buftabs_marker_modified='M'
    ```
  * `g:buftabs_active_highlight_group`
  * `g:buftabs_inactive_highlight_group`

    The name of a highlight group (:help highlight-groups) which is used to
    show the name of the current active buffer and of all other inactive
    buffers. If these variables are not defined, no highlighting is used.
    (Highlighting is only functional when g:buftabs_in_statusline is enabled)

    You can use your own highlight groups:

    ```vimscript
    hi BuftabsNormal  guifg=#D2FF2F guibg=Black
    hi BuftabsActive  guifg=#FFFFFF guibg=#2EE5FA

    let g:buftabs_active_highlight_group='BuftabsActive'
    let g:buftabs_inactive_highlight_group='BuftabsNormal'
    ```
